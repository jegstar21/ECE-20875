    # Homework 2: Data Structures in Python

### Due Friday, 02.05.2021 at 11:59 PM ET

## Goals

This homework has several objectives:

1. Write some basic Python programs.
2. Get familiar with the different data structures available in Python.
3. Leverage the concept of functions to write modular code.

## Instructions

In this homework, you need to write two Python functions, one per problem described below. Both of these function definitions are provided to you in `homework2.py`. `testhisto.py` and `testaddress.py` can be used by you to execute your functions in `homework2.py`. We have provided you with some test cases, you may make your own test case and execute to make sure your code runs properly.

### Problem 1

Create a function called `histogram` that takes as input a dataset `data`, a lower bound `b`, an upper bound `h`, and a number of bins `n`, and returns a histogram representation of `data` with `n` bins between these bounds. More specifically, your function should:

1. Have input arguments `histogram(data, n, b, h)`, expecting `data` as a list of floats, `n` as an integer, and `b` and `h` as floats.
2. Initialize the histogram `hist` as a list of `n` zeros.
3. Calculate the bin width as `w = (h-b)/n`, so that `hist[0]` will represent values in the range `[b, b + w)`, `hist[1]` in the range `[b + w, b + 2w)`, and so on through `hist[n-1]`. (Remember that `[` is inclusive while `)` is not!)
4. **Ignore any values in `data` that are less than or equal to `b`, or greater than or equal to `h`**.
5. Increment `hist[i]` by 1 for each value in `data` that belongs to bin `i`, i.e., in the range `[b + i*w, b + (i+1)*w)`.
6. Return `hist`.

At the beginning of your function, be sure to check that `n` is a positive integer and that `h >= b`; if not, your code should just print a message and return an empty list for `hist`. Your message can be customised by you, but please remember to return an empty list. 

For example, typing in

```
data = [-2, -2.2, 0, 5.6, 8.3, 10.1, 30, 4.4, 1.9, -3.3, 9, 8]
hist = histogram(data, 10, -5, 10)
print(hist)
```

should return

```
[0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1]
```
Some other test cases are:
 
```
data = [-4, -3.2, 0, 7.6, 1.0, 2.2, 30, 2.2, 1.9, -8.3, 6, 5]
hist = histogram(data, 10, -5, 10)
print(hist)
```

should return

```
[1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
```
and,
```
data = [2,2,2]
hist = histogram(data, 3, -2, 3)
print(hist)
```
returns
```
[0, 0, 3]
```
also, 
```
data = [-1,-1,-1,10,10]
hist = histogram(data, 5, -1, 10)
print(hist)
```
returns 
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Note: Please include all conditions specified in this problem into your code. 

### Problem 2

Create a function called `addressbook` that takes as input two dictionaries, `name_to_phone` and `name_to_address`, and combines them into a single dictionary `address_to_all` that contains the phone number of, and the names of all the people who live at, a given address. Specifically, your function should:

1. Have input arguments `addressbook(name_to_phone, name_to_address)`, expecting `name_to_phone` as a dictionary mapping a name (string) to a home phone number (integer or string), and `name_to_address` as a dictionary mapping a name to an address (string).
2. Create a new dictionary `address_to_all` where the keys are all the addresses contained in `name_to_address`, and the value `address_to_all[address]` for `address` is of the format `([name1,name2,...], phone)`, with `[name1,name2,...]` being the list of names living at `address` and `phone` being the home phone number for `address`. **Note**: the *value* we want in this new dictionary is a *tuple*, where the first element of the tuple is a *list* of names, and the second element of the tuple is the phone number. (Remember that while a tuple itself is immutable, a list within a tuple can be changed dynamically.) 
3. Handle the case where multiple people at the same address have different listed home phone numbers as follows: Keep the first number found, and print warning messages with the names of each person whose number was discarded.
4. Return `address_to_all`.

For example, typing in

```
name_to_phone = {'alice': 5678982231, 'bob': '111-234-5678', 'christine': 5556412237, 'daniel': '959-201-3198', 'edward': 5678982231}
name_to_address = {'alice': '11 hillview ave', 'bob': '25 arbor way', 'christine': '11 hillview ave', 'daniel': '180 ways court', 'edward': '11 hillview ave'}
address_to_all = addressbook(name_to_phone, name_to_address)
print(address_to_all)
```

should return

```
Warning: christine has a different number for 11 hillview ave than alice. Using the number for alice.
{'11 hillview ave': (['alice', 'christine', 'edward'], 5678982231), '25 arbor way': (['bob'], '111-234-5678'), '180 ways court': (['daniel'], '959-201-3198')}
```
also,
```
name_to_phone = {'alice': 5678982231, 'bob': 5678982231, 'christine': 5678982231, 'daniel': '959-201-3198', 'edward': 5678982231}
name_to_address = {'alice': '25 arbor way', 'bob': '25 arbor way', 'christine': '25 arbor way', 'daniel': '25 arbor way', 'edward': '25 arbor way'}
address_to_all_Stu = addressbook(name_to_phone, name_to_address)
print(address_to_all)
```
should output

```
Warning: daniel has a different number for 25 arbor way than alice. Using the number for alice.
{'25 arbor way': (['alice', 'bob', 'christine', 'daniel', 'edward'], 5678982231)}
```
Your message should match exactly as shown above. If more than one person has a different phone number at the same address then you may print separate messages for each instance.

Note that the specific order you get these elements back may not be the same, because sets and dictionaries do not preserve order. That is OK!

And yes, we know people rarely use home phone numbers anymore, but that doesn't change this problem being a good Python coding exercise! :)

## Testing

We have provided two test programs for you, that recreate the examples from above, in `testhisto1.py`, `testhisto2.py`, `testhisto3.py`,`testhisto4.py`, `testaddress1.py` and `testaddress2.py`, which test problems 1 and 2, respectively. Note that these test programs will only work "out of the box" if you have your solution in `homework2.py`. You may verify your code by running the test programs from the terminal. The concept of importing functions from modules or `.py` files are being used here.


## What to Submit

Put the two functions `histogram` and `addressbook` in a single file called `homework2`.

Once you have a version of this file (that you have `commit`ted using `git commit` and `push`ed using `git push`) that you are happy with, you are done!
Sit back, relax and enjoy your lectures :)
